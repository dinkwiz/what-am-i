What is the difference between a data analyst and a data scientist?

## intro
Data Science seems to be the ‘in’ subject at the moment. It’s been frequently (or over) quoted that a ‘data scientist’ is the sexiest career of the 21st Century (Forbes Magazine, 2012). I have worked within data for over ten years. I am interested in data science and have been expanding my knowledge in this area but I wouldn’t call myself a Data Scientist. I would however call myself a Data Analyst. But what’s the difference? What skills would I need to call myself a data scientist? 

## project aims
To explore the definitions of data analytics and data science.
To identify the skills and experience needed in each field.
To examine the similarities and differences.

## methods

web scrape analysis - job adverts





##thoughts, notes and randomness
I’m a Data Analyst. It might not be as cool or sexy as a data scientist but it is what I am good at. My expertise lies in analytics, using data to provide insight. Over time, I am using different techniques in my work, venturing into what some may call Data Science but at my core, I am an analyst - it might just be that data science provides me with the tools to analyse.
